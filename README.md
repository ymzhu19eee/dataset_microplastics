# dataset_microplastics
This is a dataset of microplastic particles. This dataset is used as the training, validation and test set of the research of “Holographic Classifier: Deep Learning in Digital Holography for Automatic Micro-objects Classification”, Accepted to “Special Session on Digital Holography for Industrial Applications” in the *18th IEEE International Conference on Industrial Informatics (INDIN 2020)* and “Microplastic pollution monitoring with holographic classification and deep learning,” Journal of Physics: Photonics, 2021. doi:10.1088/2515-7647/abf250

Optical System: The dataset is caught by digital inline holography system. 

Labelled by type: The types of microplastic particles are shown in their corresponding folder names.

Labelled by number: The number of microplastic particles in the image is the same as the first number of the file name of the image.

Any citation to this database needs to indicate the source of the reference.
